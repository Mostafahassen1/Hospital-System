# Cassandra Overview

Cassandra is a NoSQL distributed database known for its unique attributes:

- **Distributed Databases:** Cassandra databases are distributed, ensuring data distribution across multiple nodes.
- **Prevention of Data Loss:** The distribution mechanism acts as a safeguard against data loss resulting from hardware failure in any specific datacenter.
- **Scalability:** To leverage the full potential of Cassandra, it is recommended to run it on multiple machines, allowing for scalability and enhanced performance.
- **Node Communication:** Nodes in Cassandra communicate with each other using a protocol known as **gossip**. This protocol facilitates peer-to-peer communication among computers within the Cassandra cluster.
